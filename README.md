# gear_system_optimization
A code I wrote as part of my undergraduate studies at Saint Martin's University in Lacey, WA. 
This code is written in Matlab and takes a desired gear ratio, material properties and size constraints and produces optimized dimensions for a basic helical gear design.

Below is an image of the basic gear design.
